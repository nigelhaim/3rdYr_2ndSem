### Goals:
Us: Best thesis 
Sir: Conference or Journal (Higher)

Submission can be done even before the defense depending on sir's approval 

**Conference:**
- 3 to 6 months
- Not Free
- Registration - 500 Dollars
	- Publication free
	- Copy of proceedings
	- Tour 
- Tours and networking 
- to publish your work 
- BASTA GALA
- **Opportunities for:**
	- Masters 
	- International work 
**Journal:**
- 6 months to two years
- Free

###### What sir's goals
- Students are given to have the opportunities to do speeches 
- 3 out of 4 groups are going to Japan
- To publish his advisees work

## Meetings
- Once a week
- **Always be complete**
- Always taking down notes 
	- Can ask but cannot answer
- Calling a friend 
- Proposal
	- Once a week
	- Can be more
	- Planning stage 
	- Sir is focused on us
- Implementation
	- A bit lie low 
	- Can report 2 times a week
- ALWAYS UPDATE 
- Take initiative try to start early to find problems at the early stage 
- Our group is always after classes 
- Oral advising meeting
	- Implemented because there are 
	- We will be tested with other panelists before the final defense 
	- Collaboration from other advisees
	- Improving each other 
	- Once per month 
- Approval for defense 
	- If sir finds something wrong there will be consequences 
		- Spend another semester 
		- Change the topic 
	- Expect on the delays and deliverables 
		- Excuse of being late 
		- If the research problem is still not solid then there is a possibility of pivoting 
		- Better be now or later
		- Expect to be pressured 

#### Be aware of 
- Other advisers that could take offense on how we approach the thesis 
- Misconstrode 
- Usually on Machine learning 
- Conflicting of ideas and opinions
- Do not enforce even they are wrong 

### Being wait-listed and accepted 
- only 2 groups 
- Likes the idea and enthusiasm 
- Potential 
- Mas maganda lang yung documentation ng other groups 
- Likes our area
- All classmates have good ideas but we have a more solidified idea 


### Research guidelines
**FAILURE**
- DI dirediretso
- Possible pivot
- Implementation is the part where problems occur
- Push through vs Change topic in the last minute 
- Tyaga rin talaga siya sa ihip ng hangin

## Consultation
**Pursue**
- Available dataset 
	- Exported into image
	- Looping of image exportation 
	- Trained ACL and trained Miniscus on the same sample 
		- What is the specific problem?
			- Difficulty on the identifying of the tear and its location if there is an ACL injury
		- Bakit sila na hihirapan? 
			- Aftermath of the injury 
			- Even if before surgery because of the similarities of ACL and Meniscus
			- Sir
				- Good for introduction 
		- To classify or to segment? 
			- To classify
			- Good case
		- Before that:
			- Establish on the field 
				- Meron on research on implementation muna pero wala pang Deep Learning 
				- Focused on the individual lang but not both 
				- So far wala pa talaga nakapag attempt 
				- Sir findings: 
					- If wala pa talaga then maganda ang contribution 
					- Radiologist are validation
					- Work is already in the baseline 
					- Value what you want to do and make sure the algorithm is good 
					- Baseline approach is actually a good thing to do 
					- Review on the dataset 
						- We have to make sure about the dataset labels on the .csv 
						- Sa isang patient lang ba? 
						- Injury background 
						- There could be issues so screen the dataset 
						- Models could have a difficult
						- Be specific on the type of MRI
						- The type of injury and the background of the injury 
						- K space 
							- Consider the 3d dataset 
						- On the model 
							- Be careful on the lacking of contextual information
							- Computational cost if youre going to use 3D 
							- MRI is more focused on the Segmentation approaches 
				- Try to pivot on an alternative dataset 
				- We only have a month left if youre gonna pivot then better to pivot early 
				- Don't be too attached on the topic
				-  Ang gawin is look further details on the dataset or look for other datasets
				- Good progress is we already have a benchmark on how we look on dataset
				- Focus on the metrics too. 
				- Make sure the dataset has labels 
				- Check on the performances on other researches based on the dataset
- Kess
	- Ayusin ang problem statement
		- More on classification 

If were gonna find another topic what is a good way to find other topics
- Chismis siya 
	- Have doubts, investigate, piece together and have opinion
	- Critique the papers and find out the holes.
	- Question even the smallest things
	- Everything has an advantage and disadvantage 
	- Bakit hindi nagwowork yung current methods nila sa ACL and Meniscus
	- Way ni sir:
		- Abstract -> methodology -> Conclusions
		- Methodologies could help you find the landscape of the study 
		- Sir sometimes even skip the results 
	- For undergrads 
		- There is an architecture and we propose something 
		- Sir wants: How it could help and whats the basis of the study 
		- Based on what we have read this is the reason why they lack. 
	- Object detection 
		- Areas of interest 
		- 2 steps ahead 
		- Classify and segmentation 
			- is this really what youre looking for 

Zero shot learning 
- Separate field 
- Assuming the data is correct 
	- Better the research gap has also applied the zero shot 
- Not much familiarity 
- You can explore other models like applying R2UNet on Zero shot 
-
