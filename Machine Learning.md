## Relevance of AI 

### What is AI 
- The study and creation of machines that perform tasks normally associated with intelligence

**Psychologsts/Cognitive Scientists**
- AI is being commercialized 
**Engineers**
- AI for corporations mainly used for automations
- Ex. 
	- Spam Filters
	- Analyze for data clustering 

### Why is it relevant
- **Traditionally human capabilities** - Human labor

### How did AI Start
- The Inception of Artificial Intelligence (1943-1956)
	- Just trying to model the human brain 
- Early Enthusiasm, great expectations (1952-1969)
	- They know the physical limitations but focused on the logical and analytical part
- Dose of reality (1966-1973)
	- Back in the days (Intelligent systems 1) those are the people that creates the algorithms 
- Expert Systems (1969-1986)
	- Less generality and focus on things they can solve 
	- Focused on the If-Else AI 
	- Deterministic
- Neural networks, Machine Learning, Probalistic Reasoning (1986-present)
	- Instead of logic, Hand coding, and philosophical claims it was implemented to be automated and focused on probability
- Big Data and Deep Learning (2001-present, 2011-present)
	- Dawn of the internet 


### The Usual Machine Learning Workflow

#### Preprocessing 
- Convert it into the language the machine can understand 
- You create your features through the raw data 
	- Feature Engineering 
		- How do you identify a person? 
		- Key for good outputs 
	- Splitting the Data 
		- There is no golden ratio between training and testing data 

#### Modelling 
- Model does not mean its only machine model.

#### Evaluation 
- The most important to learn in this class

### Linear Regression

#### Loss Functions
- Current output -> Expected output 
- Loss function is the relationship between the hypothesis and conclusion 


$t = \text{target or  predictions}$
$X = \text{input}$
$X^{(i)} \text{ for which } t^{(i)} = \text{Training samples}$
The relationship of $X \text{ and } t$ = Model 
Tells how the model approximates the target given the training = Loss
Finding the parameters of a model  = Optimization 

**We square values to make exponential adjustments based on the results**



**Stochastic **
- Tignan isa isa bago update kaagad
**Batch**
- Tignan lahat bago update 

$\lambda$ - learning rate

AI - The study and creation of machines that perform tasks normally associated with intelligence 
Relevance - Can be applied to every sector new possibilities and efficiencies 

**Phsychologists** - how people work. Machine can help
**Engineers** - building machines can do useful tasks 

Inception (43-56)
- model of artificial neurons 
- any computable function could be computed by some network of connected neurons 

Enthusiasm, great expectations (52-69)
- researchers responded by demonstrating 
- taks considered indicative of intelligence in humans 

Reality(66-73)
- primarily based on "informed introspection"
- lack of appreciation of intractability 
Expert Systems (69-86)
- Alternative to weak methods - use more powerful domain-specific knowledge taht allows larger reasoning steps 
Neural Networks, ML, Prob reasoning(86-)
- Reinvented the back-propagation learning algorithm 
- more scientific approach incorporating probability
Big Data and Deep Leearning (2001-, 2011-)
- BigData - Large datasets 
- deep learning - ML using mutliple layers of simple, adjustable computing elements (CNN - 1970)

ML - takes examples and produces a program that does the job

Output space - Target variable that is desired to be estimated 
Hypothesis - speculative relationship between the input and output spaces
Input space - Variables/Features/Attributes

Types of learning 

Supervised - Maps inputs to outputs. Learning to predict an output given an input vector. Learning by examples.

Classification - Categoral outputs 
Regression - Real-valued outputs 

Unsupervised - Learn patterns in input data without feedback. Create an internal representation of the input, capturing regularities/structure in data. Learning by discovery. Output corresponding to input is not provided 

Reinforcement - Learn actions causing occasional rewards and punishments. Learn by experimentation 

Pre processing- includes anything that needs to be done on the data prior to feeding it to the model 

Feature engineering - Manipulation of the data set to improve machine learning model training. 

Data cleaning - proccess of fixing or removing, incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset

Scaling and Normalization - transform the range of features of data. 

Splitting the Data - model validation procedure that allows to simulate how a model would perform 

Modelling - description of a system using math concepts represents of objects and relationships and languages 

Evaluation - process of using different evaluation to understand a machine a ML model's performance, strengths and weaknesses


AI - Intelligent behavior - ML - learning from data to make predictions - DL - Learning using artificial neural networks 

Loss Functions - computes the distance between current output and the expected output. Maps an event or values of one or more variables onto a real number 

Optimization problem seeks to minimize a loss function 


Regression - statistical technique that relates a dependent variable to one/more independent variables
What to predict 
![[Pasted image 20240314182029.png]]


Batch updates - sum of average updates accross every example

Stochastic updates - update parameters for each training case in turn according to its won gradients
Gradient descent to solve for each coefficient, or compute analytically.

Generalization is the modelâ€™s ability to predict the held out data

ridge regression -penalty on the squared weights
