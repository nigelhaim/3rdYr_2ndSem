We have statuses in life 

If we do not face our challenges then we don't grow 

The difference of google and teachers, teachers have heart

#### What does it mean to be CATHOLIC?
- Is it possible that many churches are preparing young Christians to face a world that no longer exist?
- Who the Lord calls us to be 
- How the lord calls us to become 
- What the Lord calls us to do 

**Ang Tomasino ay mahusay at may puso**

Like a knife students have to be sharp

Students are how and Teachers are the what
