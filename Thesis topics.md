## Medical Image Segmentation Ideas:

**Specific Tasks:**

- **Tumor segmentation:** Develop a robust method to automatically segment different types of tumors (e.g., brain, lung, liver) from various modalities (MRI, CT, PET). Explore challenges like low-contrast boundaries, varying shapes, and presence of artifacts.
- **Organ segmentation:** Improve the accuracy of segmenting crucial organs like heart, lungs, kidneys, and bones for tasks like surgical planning, radiotherapy dose calculation, and functional analysis.
- **Lesion segmentation:** Segment specific lesions on various tissues, such as skin cancer on dermoscopy images, white matter lesions in the brain, or inflammatory lesions in the lungs. Focus on handling overlapping structures and subtle intensity variations.
- **Cell segmentation:** Develop algorithms for accurate segmentation of individual cells in microscopy images for tasks like cell counting, lineage tracking, and drug screening. Address challenges like overlapping cells, complex shapes, and varying illumination.
- **Blood vessel segmentation:** Segment blood vessels from retinal fundus images or coronary angiograms to assess vascular health, diagnose diseases like diabetic retinopathy, and plan interventions. Overcome challenges like branching structures, variable thickness, and noise.

**Methodological Approaches:**

- **Deep learning with novel architectures:** Develop specialized architectures suited for medical image segmentation, like U-Net variants, attention-based models, or recurrent networks for 3D data.
- **Incorporating prior knowledge:** Integrate anatomical atlases, shape priors, or domain-specific rules into the segmentation process to guide the model towards accurate results.
- **Multi-modal segmentation:** Combine information from different imaging modalities (e.g., MRI and PET) to improve segmentation accuracy and capture complementary information.
- **Unsupervised and weakly supervised learning:** Reduce reliance on large amounts of labeled data by exploring self-supervised learning techniques or leveraging weakly labeled data with active learning or uncertainty sampling.
- **Explainable segmentation:** Develop methods that not only accurately segment images but also provide insights into the segmentation decisions, aiding diagnosis and treatment planning.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Focus on a specific clinical application:** Align your research with a real-world problem and collaborate with medical professionals to ensure clinical relevance and impact.
- **Evaluate on publicly available datasets:** Utilize standard datasets like MICCAI or BraTS to benchmark your method and compare it to existing approaches.
- **Consider computational efficiency and real-time processing:** If developing for clinical applications, optimize your method for efficient inference on available hardware.
## Medical Image Segmentation Topics Focused on the Philippines:


**Addressing Local Health Challenges:**

- **Developing AI-powered segmentation tools for diseases prevalent in the Philippines:** Focus on diseases like tuberculosis (chest X-ray segmentation), dengue fever (liver ultrasound segmentation), or schistosomiasis (blood smear image segmentation).
- **Segmenting medical images from resource-limited settings:** Adapt or develop segmentation models that work accurately even with low-quality images or limited computing power, common in resource-constrained regions.
- **Segmentation of medical images for under-diagnosed or under-treated conditions:** Focus on conditions with limited resources for diagnosis, like neglected tropical diseases or specific cancers prevalent in the Philippines.
