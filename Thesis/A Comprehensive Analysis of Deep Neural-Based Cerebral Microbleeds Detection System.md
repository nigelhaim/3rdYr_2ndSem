An analysis of Cerebral Microbleeds detection system conducted by Ferlin et al. (2021). They used a High in-plane resolution dataset and a Low in-plane resolution dataset with the in-pane resolutions of 0.5 × 0.5 mm${}^2$ and 0.8 × 0.8 mm${}^2$ respectively. The proposed model was also tested on a different dataset with a similar in-pane resolution of 0.45 × 0.45 mm${}^2$. Their extensive analysis and experiments were conducted to propose a way of synthesis the suitable DNN-based system for reliable CMB detection, which shows high performance and generalization ability (Ferlin et al., 2021).  The data was pre-processed through image resizing to 512 × 512 and 288 × 288 for the Low in-pane resolution data, however the aspect ratio is not modified. The data was also standardized and Normalized through the reduction of the value of a single pixel. To distinguish Microbleeds from their mimics, the Ferlin et al. (2021) took advantage of the 3 DNN input channels that each channel was used as a separate input. Since MRI is a one channel image, each channel can process one image. The model also analyzes the sequence of adjacent slices where the cerebral microbleed can be traced and verified based on the slices in the detected candidate location. The images were also randomly flipped and rotated between 0$^{\circ}$ and 90$^{\circ}$ Ferlin et al. (2021) also considered in modifying the original labels in the dataset, they also generated their own dataset which is consulted with a Machine Learning expert and a radiologist. The model used is Faster R-CNN structure and ResNet50 architecture as a feature extraction backbone. These two-stage detectors are computationally expensive, however they are one of the most effective models in detecting small objects. Through transferred learning, they have adopted the network weights from ResNet-50-FPN that is pretrained on the COCO dataset to facilitate the accelerated learning. Post processing includes the verification of ground truth and the verification of false positives. Through Intersection over Union of 40% that calculates if the predicted box has 40% in common with the ground truth. It is also checked along with the method of checking the adjacent slices. The proposed model 2D Faster RCNN achieved 92.62% Sensitivity, 89.74% of Precision, 90.84% of the F1 Score, and 0.24 of False Positive Average.
