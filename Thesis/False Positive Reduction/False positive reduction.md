Cerebral Microbleed mimics are one of the major causes of false positives in automated detection of Cerebral Microbleeds. CMB mimics in SWI or higher field strength MRI become more problematic using methods with higher sensitivity to susceptibility. CMB mimics largely arise in T2*-weighted images to paramagnetic substances other than hemosiderin, including calcifications, iron deposits, or deoxyhemoglobin (Greenberg et al., 2009). The presence of CMB mimics along with algorithmic errors can lead to significant number of false positives (Ferlin et al., 2023). To address these mimics in the differentiation of actual CMBs and their mimics, different approaches was done based on the model's performance and algorithm in detecting the CMB candidate. A comprehensive review of Ferlin et al. (2023) stated that even with the implementation of this stage, certain approaches still have not managed to acquire satisfying quality. 

**Manual elimination by a radiologist**

One of the most significant ways to reduce false positives is to be evaluated by a radiologist.
