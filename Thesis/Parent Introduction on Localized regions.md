Advancements in deep learning have paved the way for the creation of computer-aided systems in the field of medical imaging. Many studies have specifically designed models to enhance cerebral microbleeds' detection and analysis. These microbleeds have significant implications for various neurological diseases, thus making their accurate identification important and critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning. Leveraging machine learning techniques can help automate and refine the detection process, which can help overcome the limitations of traditional manual methods that are tedious, time-consuming, and subject to human error. This includes the concept of using localized regions where it introduces the utilization of obtaining Regions of Interest in the brain to improve accuracy (Li et al., 2022). It is also applied on T2*-Weighted Gradient Recalled Echo images where the model of Chesebro et al. (2021) detects microbleeds over longitudinal scans. It provides the researchers of this study an overview on how localization was used in previous studies. The introduction of automatic detection systems for CMBs opens new possibilities for neuroimaging and provides improvements in the field of healthcare.
