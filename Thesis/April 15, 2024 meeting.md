3 SOP

How global detection 
- Learning rate 
- Triplanar plane (Axial, Coronial, Sagittal)
	- If only axial was used the learning rate is slow 
	- The hack 
		- Higher learning rate = Higher the curve 
	- Main question
Weird part 
- The number of adjacent slices is consistent for every sample 
	- Not all microbleed is the same size/length 
	- The slices are static 
- Additional parameter the number of slices 
- "Challenge" convert into "It is not detected because....."
- 1 is general 
- 2 is specific 
- 2 proposals if kaya 
	- 1st Per slice is the axial plane is a localized attention to a microbleed that could also help detect other microbleed
		- Using the attention mechanism the the microbleed will be detected in every adjacent slice
		- Features will be obtained on each slice
		- One could be come the issue 
			- The attention mechanism depends on each slice any misinfomration could ruin the model's performanc
		- How to solve it? 
		- Kasama sa pag classify per pixel sa SOP
		- 
		- Chat GPT 
			- Use chat GPT to rephrase what you want on your SOP 
	- **Rephrase but not the content**
