# Operations Research
## Pre concepts 

### Objective 
- Allocate the scarce resources in an effective manner to the various military operations and to the activities within each operation.


#### Business manager 
- Perfoms many tasks 

### Quantitative methods or Operation Research (Tool) 
- Application of scientific methods of analysis 
- provide those in control of the operation
- Quantitative approach
- Involves the prediction of various courses of action 
- Helps choose between alternative actions

### Functions
-  rule that associates with each of a set, called domain
- Combined with operations of $+,-,*,/$ (just like numbers)

**Domain** == set 
**Range** - An element of the Domain
**Ordered tuple** - Two having the same first element also have the same second element 


### Inequalities
- $>,<,>=,<=$ 
- Basta anything that is unequal 
*Example* 
- 1<2
- $(a+2) >= 2$
**Properties**
1. The sense of an inequality is unchanged if the same real number is added to or subtracted from both sides.
	- Example
		- If a > b, then a + c > b + c and a – c > b – c.
		- Lets say (a = 5, b = 2, c =1)
			- If 5>2, then 5 + 1 > 2 and 5 - 1 > 2 - 1. 
2. The sense of an inequality is unchanged if both sides are multiplied  or divided by the same positive number.
	- Example 
		- If a > b, then ac > bc and a/c > b/c.
		- Lets say (a = 10, b = 5, c=20)
			- If 10>5, then $10*20>5*20$ and $10/20 > 5/20$
3. The sense of an inequality is reversed if both sides are multiplied  or divided by the same negative number.
	- Example 
		- If a > b, then ac < bc and a/c < b/c.
		- Lets say (a = 10, b = 5, c=-20)
			- If 10 > 5, then $(10*-20) < (5*-20)$ and $(10/-20) < (5/-20)$

### Solution and Graph of an Inequality
Since conditional inequality is not true for all permissible values of the variable(s) involved, solving it consists of finding the values or range of values which satisfy the inequality.

#### The Graph of an Inequality
**Sketching the graph of an inequality involves two steps:**
1. Sketch the graph of the corresponding equation, and
2. Determine the half plane of points which satisfy the given inequality.

### Systems of Linear Equations
- A system of m linear equations in the n unkowns $x_1,x_2,...,x_n$

Where $a_{ij},b_i$ belongs to the real field R. An n-tuple u=($k_1,k_2,...,k_n$) of real numbers is a solution (particular solution) if it satisfies each of the equations; the set of all such solution is termed the solution set or the general solution.  

### Matrices
- A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers which is called an entry or element of the matrix 

>[!Note]- Matrix 
>![[Pasted image 20240115220031.png]]

**m x n matrix** - A matrix with m rows and n columns
**n x n matrix** - A matrix that both rows and columns are equal (m=n)
**Row Vector** - A matrix with one row
**Column Vector** - A Matrix with one column


### Matrix Addition
Let A = $[a_{ij}]$ and B = $[b_{ij}]$ be m x n matrices, then A + B = $[a_{ij} + b{ij}]$

### Scalar Multiplication 
Let A = $[a_{ij}]$ and $B = [b_{ij}]$ be an m x n matrix and k a scalar, then kA = $k[a_{ij}]=[ka_{ij}]$

### Matrix multiplication
Let A = $[a_{ij}]$ be an m x p matrix and B = $[b_{ij}]$ be a p x n matrix then AB = C where C = $[c_{ij}]$ and $c{ij} = a_{j1}b_{1j}+a_{i2}b_{2j}+...+a_{ip}b_{pj}$

**The rows of both matrices should be equal or the product is not defined**

### Basic concept of Probability 
- Deals with the question as to the chance that a certain event will happen 

m = ways it can happen 
n = ways it won't happen 

The probability of happening = $\frac{m}{m+n}$
The probability it won't happen = $\frac{n}{m+n}$

**Probability Scale**

1 = It would happen
0 = It won't happen
p = The probability of will happen
q = the probability of will NOT happen

If 
	p = 1 
then 
	q  = 1 - p
